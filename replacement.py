# Task
# Find the minimal possible sequence after performing a valid replacement and sorting the sequence.

# Input:
# Input contains sequence with N integers. All elements of the sequence > 0. The sequenc will never be empty.

# Output:
#â€‚Return sequence with N integers â€” the minimum possible values of each sequence element after one replacement and the sorting are performed.

# Examples:

# ([1,2,3,4,5])  =>  [1,1,2,3,4]
# ([4,2,1,3,5])  =>  [1,1,2,3,4]
# ([2,3,4,5,6])  =>  [1,2,3,4,5]
# ([2,2,2])      =>  [1,2,2]
# ([42])         =>  [1]
